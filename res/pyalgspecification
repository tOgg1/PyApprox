(General structuring if variables and objects)
(Objects are defined as follows)

objectname:objectflag ( = objectvalue)?

(there are two types of objects, scopeobjects and infoobjects)
(scopeobjects can ONLY have an openflag and a start flag)
(i.e. objectname:start/objectname:end) 

(Elements are defined as follows)

element = {value_i? = <value>, +}

(value_i is the identifier and does not have to be specified,)
(as it is often implicitly defined (see below))
